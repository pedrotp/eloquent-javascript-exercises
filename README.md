# eloquent-javascript-exercises

These are my solutions to the exercises at the end of every chapter in [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/).


### File name notation:

Files are named starting with the chapter number **(c00)** followed by the number **(e00)** and the title of the exercise separated by dashes.

*i.e.: c02-e02-fizzbuzz.js represents exercise number 2 from chapter 2, which has the title "Fizzbuzz".*
